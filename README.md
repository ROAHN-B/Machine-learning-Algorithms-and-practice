# 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms & Practice

This repository contains my **practical implementations and experiments with Machine Learning algorithms**.

It is focused on **hands-on learning**, where I apply ML concepts through code to strengthen my understanding of:

* How algorithms work
* When to use them
* How model performance changes with different parameters

The repository reflects my **continuous improvement in practical Machine Learning skills** through regular practice and experimentation.

📌 Technologies used: **Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn**

🚀 This repository is actively updated as I keep learning and exploring Machine Learning.
